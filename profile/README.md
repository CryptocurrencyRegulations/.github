## Hi there 👋

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction

Regulations is a hard problem in cryptocurrencies,  
and the gate for people to gain trust in the system.

As trust in crypto is building up slow and later crash and burn,  
- We shoud either accept that crypto have another 10 years to go  
- Or some crisis will force it on us
- Or we will build a regulation tool that will help us ensure crypto safety.

The question about regulations is who will be responsible to enforce them
- will it be goverments & contries?
- will it be an authoritative professionals?
- or will it be decentrelized?

For me, the first two, are a big NO NO  
and against what crypto currencies are all about - **freedom**.

Question is how to create a decentrelized regulation system that will enforce crypto safety and advocate freedom.

What hard problems should regulation solve (Cross Blockchains)
1. Protect Against Crypto Fraud & Hacks
2. Crypto Identity & Identity Creditability
3. Allow external regulators policies
4. Cross-wallets/Cross chains cash flow transparency

Also as a side affect the benefit of external services such as:  
- unified data collected from all blockchanins 
- human ATM
- financial crypto blanace sheet, activities and ROI's
- financial management system
- credit score
- commerce gateway

# Decentrelized Regulation System

The systems I envisioned so far:
- Decentrelized Transaction Verifier Server
- Decentrelized
